      <p>New Era University College: An Introduction
        New Era University College (NEUC) was established in 1997 following the closure of Nanyang University in Singapore in 1980. It was the outcome of many years of efforts in addition to unwavering support from the Malaysian Chinese community.
        NEUC is a non-profit, private university college in Malaysia. On 30 December 2016, New Era was upgraded to University College status by the Ministry of Higher Education. This upgrading allows NEUC to offer its own undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. All courses offered by NEUC are approved by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA). The qualifications awarded by NEUC are also accredited by the Chinese Service Centre for Scholarly Exchange (CSCSE) under the mutual recognition of qualifications agreement between Malaysia and China. NEUC is also listed on Chinaâ€™s JSJ Study Abroad website. NEUC started its first dedicated class for international students from China in July 2020 and has welcomed more than 400 international students since then. Chinese postgraduate and undergraduate students make up the majority of international students, while other international students from countries such as Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea, Myanmar, Laos, The United States of America, and Canada are also enrolled.</p>
